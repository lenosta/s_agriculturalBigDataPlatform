    <h1>JSP 2.0 Examples - Panels using Tag Files</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This JSP page invokes a custom tag that draws a
    panel around the contents of the tag body.  Normally, such a tag
    implementation would require a Java class with many println() statements,
    outputting HTML.  Instead, we can use a .tag file as a template,
    and we don't need to write a single line of Java or even a TLD!</p>
